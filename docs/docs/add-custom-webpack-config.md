title: "Add custom webpack config"
---

_Before creating custom webpack configuration, check to see if there's a Gatsby
plugin already built that handles your use case in the
[plugins section](/docs/plugins/). If there's not yet one and your use case is a
general one, we highly encourage you to contribute back your plugin to the
Gatsby Plugin Library so it's available to others (including your future self ðŸ˜€)._

To add custom webpack configurations, create (if there's not one already) a
`gatsby-node.js` file in your root directory. Inside this file, export a
function called `onCreateWebpackConfig`.

When Gatsby creates its webpack config, this function will be called allowing
you to modify the default webpack config using
[webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge).

Gatsby does multiple webpack builds with somewhat different configuration. We
call each build type a "stage". The following stages exist:

1.  develop: when running the `gatsby develop` command. Has configuration for hot
    reloading and CSS injection into page
2.  develop-html: same as develop but without react-hmre in the babel config for
    rendering the HTML component.
3.  build-javascript: production JavaScript and CSS build. Creates route JS bundles as well
    as commons chunks for JS and CSS.
4.  build-html: production build static HTML pages

Check
[webpack.config.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/utils/webpack.config.js)
for the source.

There are many plugins in the Gatsby repo using this API to look to for examples
e.g. [Sass](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sass/),
[Typescript](/packages/gatsby-plugin-typescript/),
[Glamor](/packages/gatsby-plugin-glamor/), and many more!

## Example

Here is an example that configures **flexboxgrid** when processing css files. Add this in `gatsby-node.js`:

```js
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({
  stage,
  rules,
  loaders,
  plugins,
  actions,
}) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.less$/,
          // We don't need to add the matching ExtractText plugin
          // because gatsby already includes it and makes sure its only
          // run at the appropriate stages, e.g. not in development
          use: plugins.extractText.extract({
            fallback: loaders.style(),
            use: [
              loaders.css({ importLoaders: 1 }),
              // the postcss loader comes with some nice defaults
              // including autoprefixer for our configured browsers
              loaders.postcss(),
              `less-loader`,
            ],
          }),
        },
      ],
    },
    plugins: [
      plugins.define({
        __DEVELOPMENT__: stage === `develop` || stage === `develop-html`,
      }),
    ],
  })
}
```
