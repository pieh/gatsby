# Deploy to Github Pages with travis-ci

Github Pages is a solution to host static websites directly in your Github repository by pushing site files to `gh-pages` branch.

Define the basic travis-ci configuration to build and push your site's built files to the `gh-pages` branch on each new commit on master.
